# Finora

**Digital finance, reimagined through motion.**

Finora is a conceptual interface designed to strip away the complexity of traditional banking. The goal was to create a financial ecosystem that feels less like a spreadsheet and more like a fluid, interactive narrative.

This project focuses on **Reactive UI**—where every scroll and interaction provides immediate, tactile feedback to the user.

### The Design Philosophy

* **Fluidity over Grids:** Moving away from static layouts to a scroll-driven experience that guides the user’s eye naturally.
* **Atmosphere:** Utilizing a Cyberpunk-inspired palette (Neon/Dark Mode) combined with glassmorphism to create depth and hierarchy.
* **Performance:** A deliberate focus on optimizing heavy assets and scripts to run smoothly in a local environment without latency.

### Technical Detail

Built using **Vanilla JavaScript** to maintain lightweight architecture, coupled with **GSAP (GreenSock)** for complex timeline management. The code structure has been refactored for modularity, ensuring that the visual weight does not compromise render speed.
